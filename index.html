<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This website was created for the purpose of cataloging and reviewing the media I like, in order to allow others some insight into my tastes. Throughout the site you will find links to various pages on different topics. </p>

<p>I have decided to include pages for film, music and books as I feel that these are the topics I can write most about. You will find that the pages will include various types of content such as lists,reviews and a general overview of the topic discusssed.
