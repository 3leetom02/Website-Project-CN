  <h2>Currently reading: Phillip K. Dick - Time Out of Joint</h2>
  <p>I'm still working my way through this novel. I wanted to read some more PKD after reading Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep and I decided to go with one of his lesser known stories. I will keep reading and hopefully update this once I'm finished with some final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Read:</h2>

<h3 class="header-3">Cormac Mccarthy - Blood Meridian</h3>
<P>As its name suggests, this is a very brutal book. One of the most brutal you will ever read most likely. It is a western  about a young child who runs away from home and joins a gang known as Glanton's gang. It spares none of the gorey details as Mccarthy talks explores how these gang members go from town to town massacring everything in sight. Men, women and children are maimed and brutalised in equal measure and throughout the book it is frequently mentioned that the ground is littered with bones. </P>
<p>Unlike some novels, this is not However, a one-sided tale. The native tribes that Glanton and the other American Gangs encounter are often times just as blood thirsty and remoarseless. There is a section of the novel where 'The Kid' our protagonist visits a travelling medicine show. Only to find the head of his gang's leader Captain White on full display.</p>
<p>The novel is a difficult read for reasons over than its graphic content. McCarthy frequently uses archaic terms, tricky metaphors and geological terms among other things, which can often make this a tough read. It helps to have a dictionary or Google open when reading.</p>
<p>If you can get past the complexity, which can be intimidating at times, You will likely find this to be engrossing and fascinating book which explores themes of fate, religion and the nature of good and evil amongst other themes.</p>

<H3 class="header-3">Franz Kafka - The Trial</H3>
<p>Like a lot of Kafka's work, this strange and surreal book feautures a protagonist who has a dire situation thrust upon him wih no explanation. On his 30 birthday, Josef K, a high ranking bank official is arrested by two guards. He is provided with no explanation for his crimes, never told what he is being charged for or who brought the charges against him.</p>
<p>Throughout the novel, meets with various people connected to the coursts in order to try and aid him in his defence. However, he gradually comes to the realisation that he is fighting against a system which is far more powerful than he first percieves. </p>
<p>Some of the most challenging aspects of this novel are its formatting and the fact that it is translated from German. seeking to create an oppressive atmosphere, Kafka often forgoes paragraphs meaning that you are presented with giant walls of text. This is one daunting aspect, but there is also the issue of translation. Depending on the version you have, the text can often be quite a literal translation which may sound strange to people reading the book in English.</p>
<p>I would say this book is definitely worth a read, it is one of the most unique stories I have read and also one of the most frustrating from the protagonists perspective. Seeing him slowly begin to realise that his fate is likely unalterable is a gripping experience.</p>
<H3 class="header-3">Phillip K. Dick - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</H3>
</div>
<p>As a lot of people will know, this book was the inspiration for Ridley Scott's dystopian sci-fi classic Blade Runner. For anyone who has both read the book and seen the film, it will become apparent that it is not a direct adaptation.</p>
<p>Rick Deckard is a hitman contracted to kill six Nexus-6 android units that have escaped from Mars. The book is set in the aftermath of a nuclear war refferred to as 'world war terminus.'Deckard's motivation for doing this job is to be able to afford a real animal. In the dystopian future of the book, people can buy fake animals and Deckard has a fake sheep.</p>
<p>Although a lot of characters remain the same, there are some drastic differences in 'Androids' compared to Blade Runner. Wilbur Mercer and the idea of Mercerism is an idea never explicitly mentioned in Blade Runner, but is an interesting aspect of the book. A kind of religious belief system, characters in the book follow the teachings of Wilbur Mercer, a mysterious figure, people can 'fuse' with Mercer through the use of an empathy box which allows everybody who uses it to have a collective experience of sympathising with him.</p>
<p>Dick came up with the idea for the book as a result of research he'd done when writing his alternate history novel The Man in the High Castle. Dick came across an account of a nazi officer complaining that the screams of starving childen were keeping him awake. Dick became covinced that the difference between humanity and inhumanity is the ability to experience empathy, thus came up with the idea of the android, an entity which is indistinquishble from a human in every way except for the fact that they lack the ability to empathise. </p>
<p>This is reflected in the novel by Rick Deckard, who through the course of the novel begins to empathise with the androids. This fundamentally demonstrates the humanity of Deckard. </p>
<P>In summary, this is rightfully a classic of the sci-fi genre and a book which any fan of Blade Runner or sci-fi in general, should read. </P>
