<h2>The Shining (1980) Review.</h2>
<h3 class="filmh3">It's one of the most renowned horror films of all time, but I'd never seen it. Until recently.</h3>
<p>Ah, The shining who hasn't seen it? Well...me, until recently. It's always hard for a film to live up to expectations when you hear constantly that it's one of the best films ever made. After all, it's Stanley Kubrick who has several "Greatest films of all time" claims made for his work. I found The Shining to be an atmospheric and tense film with some great performances. However, the greatest horror film of all time? Not in my opinion. </p>
<p>First let's start with the aformentioned good. The film has several iconic moments and good performances, made better by Kubrick's tight cinematrophy. A great example of this is the maze scene early on in the film. Kubrick brings the camera in close giving the maze a clostraphobic feeling. An ingenious way to setup the ending to film as it really gives you a good sense of how easy it is to get lost inside of the maze. Another example of great camera work from Kubrick in the film is the tense and unnerving twin scene. Throughout this scene, Kubrick films Danny and his bike with wide angles which really emphasize the vastness of the hallways and build the tension nicely.</p>
<h3 class="filmh3">And now for Jack Nicholson...</h3>
<p>Of course, another great aspect of The shining and the selling point of the film in my opinion is Jack Nicholson's terrific performance as Jack Torrance. The writer who is driven to psychosis by the demonic happenings in the hotel. Nicholson plays his part perfectly being able to turn from understated to over the top when he's required, he becomes more deranged and disshevelled as the film goes on. Eventually becoming the monster who's willing to murder his own wife and child that we all know today. The "here's Johnny" moment may have lost some of its affect over the years due to being played out. However, it is a genuinely brilliant and terrifying illustration of Jack's insanity. </p>
<h2>But it's not all good...</h2>
<p>Despite my previous positive comments, I didn't find it all to be great. My biggest problem with the film would be its length. It may be controversial to say, but it is too long. It takes so long for what to be honest feels like a foregone conclusion to actually take place. Secondly, my main problem with the film, and this may be a consequence of it beimg such a well film, is that I found that I knew how it was going to end. That really hurt my enjoyment of the film overall as a lot of its most affective moments have been broken down and discussed to the point where even people who haven't seen the film know about them.</p>
<h4 class="filmh4">Overall, it is a film that everyone has to see, with plenty of tense, creepy and surreal moments. However, I think it would have had more of an effect on me if I saw it when I was younger.</h4>
